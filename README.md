**The Javascript library for Fritzing data.**

 Easily parse all Fritzing data into ready-to-use Javascript objects. Complete with helper functions and documentation, `fritzing-js` provides a basic Javascript interface into the fundamentals of the Fritzing universe.

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Under Development

As of this writing, the library has transitioned from `stable` to `development` as we work on modularizing, documenting, and expanding it for official release on `npm`. You can still find the old version in [Release v0.2.0](https://github.com/freetzing/fritzing-js/releases/tag/v0.2.0), complete with basic examples and supportive of *all* Fritzing data types.

Nightly changes can be found over at the [development](https://github.com/freetzing/fritzing-js/tree/dev) branch as we prepare for release.
